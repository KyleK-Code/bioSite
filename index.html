    <!-- Short bio text -->
    <div class="bio-text">
      <p>Mason "Lake" Sanderson, the rifler for M80, has carved out a name for himself in the Counter-Strike scene with a journey that began like many others, just a kid picking up the game. What made him stick with it was the competitive rush, something he feels is unmatched in other games. For Lake, it's all about the team dynamic, with most of his time dedicated to scrims and preparing for upcoming matches rather than solo queue. His proudest moment so far was the overtime victory against OG, a grueling match that showcased M80's resilience and his own individual skill.</p>

      <p>Balancing his pro gaming career with his personal life is a constant challenge, but he makes it work by carving out a disciplined routine. When he's not in-game, you might find him relaxing with some different hobbies to keep a good mindset. He has stated he is into being physically active, keeping his body in shape for competition, and just for overall health. He is also a huge advocate for disconnecting and just being with his friends and family, and you can see this reflected positively in the game, because he has been putting up amazing statistics in his most recent games. Don't let the video games fool you, Mason is a killer outside the game and trains in Brazilian Ji-Jitsu. He's got his sights set on bigger things, like winning a major trophy with M80 and continuing to climb the ranks of professional CS2. With a bright future ahead of him, Lake is a testament to the fact that passion and hard work can turn a casual hobby into a pro career.</p>
