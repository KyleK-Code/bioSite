  <h3>Interview with Mason "Lake" Sanderson</h3>

  <p class="question"> Hello, I’m Mason “Lake” Sanderson, and I’m a rifler for M80.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: How did you first get into Counter-Strike?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: I actually got into Counter-Strike back in 2016. My older brother was super into CS:GO at the time, and I remember watching him play and thinking how cool it looked. I finally convinced him to let me try it out, and I’ve been hooked ever since.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: What made you stick with CS2 instead of other competitive games?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: For me, it’s the competitive depth and the high skill ceiling. There are so many layers to the game—the strategy, the mechanics, the team play. It’s a game you can always improve at, and the feeling of executing a perfect play with your teammates is just something else. Other games just don't have that same appeal for me.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: Do you mostly play ranked, FACEIT, or scrims with a team?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: I mainly focus on scrims with my team, M80. That’s where the real growth happens. Playing with your teammates, working on strats, and fixing mistakes in a low-pressure environment is crucial for us. Of course, I'll hop on FACEIT every now and then to keep my individual mechanics sharp, but the team's practice comes first.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: What’s been your proudest moment in CS2 so far?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: My proudest moment so far has to be the overtime win against OG. That match was insane. We were down, and it looked like we were going to lose, but we managed to claw our way back. It was a true test of our team's mental fortitude, and pulling off that win was an incredible feeling. It showed me what we’re capable of when we work together.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: How do you balance gaming with school/work/personal life?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: It's definitely tough, but discipline is key. I treat my practice schedule like a job. I have set hours for gaming, VOD review, and team meetings. Outside of that, I make sure to dedicate time to my personal life. I try to be very intentional with my time and make sure I’m not neglecting anything important.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: Do you have a practice routine or warm-up ritual?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: Yes, I do. My warm-up ritual is pretty standard. I’ll usually spend about 30 minutes in an aim botz map to get my crosshair placement and flicking down. Then I’ll hop into a few deathmatch games to get used to different weapons and angles. Before a match, I'll review our opponent's previous matches and key strategies to be prepared.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: What are your favorite maps and weapons, and why?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: My favorite map is probably Inferno. I love the close-quarters fights and the strategic depth of the map. It feels like a chess match. As for a weapon, I’m a rifler, so it’s gotta be the AK-47. It’s the most versatile weapon in the game, and the one-tap headshot is so satisfying.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: Have you ever competed in a league, tournament, or LAN event?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: Yes, many. I've competed in various leagues and tournaments throughout my career. I’ve had the chance to compete in some awesome LAN events, and those are always the most memorable experiences. The energy from the crowd and the high stakes make it an unreal experience.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: What are your future goals in CS2 (e.g., rank, pro team, streaming)?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: My main goal is to win a Major with M80. That’s the dream for any professional player. I also want to continue improving as a player and a teammate, and to keep building a legacy with M80. Streaming and connecting with the community is something I'd like to do more of in the future, but right now my focus is completely on competitive play.</p>

  <p class="question">Q: What do you enjoy outside of gaming that helps keep you balanced?</p>
  <p class="answer">A: Outside of gaming, I love to lift weights at the gym and practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Both of those activities help me take my mind off the game and keep me physically and mentally fit. It’s a great way to relieve stress and stay balanced.</p>
